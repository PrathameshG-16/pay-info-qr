# Deployment Requirements for PayQR Application

## System Requirements
- Docker Engine v20.10+
- Docker Compose v2.0+ (optional, for local development)
- 1GB RAM minimum
- 1 CPU core minimum

## Ports
- Port 8080 for HTTP traffic (non-privileged port)

## Environment Variables (if needed)
# No environment variables are currently required for this application

## Deployment Instructions
1. Ensure Docker is installed on your system
2. Build the Docker image:
   ```
   docker build -t payqr-app .
   ```
3. Run the container:
   ```
   docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name payqr-container payqr-app
   ```
4. Access the application at http://localhost:8080 (or your server IP:8080)

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter permission issues with Nginx, the Dockerfile includes fixes for common permission problems
- For persistent permission issues, you can run the container with additional privileges:
  ```
  docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name payqr-container --user root payqr-app
  ```
  Note: Running as root is not recommended for production environments

## Health Check
- The application should respond on the root path '/'
